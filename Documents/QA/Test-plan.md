<h1>Testing Plan</h1>

#### Scope : ALGOSUP is asked to write a **binding generator in Fsharp** to diversify the use of languages for their game engine "Harfang 3D".
#### Date of the delivery : 17th february 2023.

**Unit testing of C++ library:**<br>
The C++ library should be thoroughly tested to ensure that all functions are working as expected and that there are no bugs or errors. This should include both functional and non-functional testing (e.g. performance testing).

**Compatibility testing:**<br>
Test that the C++ library can be successfully compiled and linked with the F# code. Verify that the exported functions are accessible and that their signatures match the expected input and output types.

**Functional testing of F# code:**<br>
Verify that the F# code correctly calls the functions in the C++ library and that the results are as expected. This should include testing different input values and edge cases to ensure that the code is robust.

**Integration testing:**<br>
Test the entire system together to ensure that the F# code and C++ library are working seamlessly and that there are no issues with data transfer or conversion.

**Performance testing:**<br>
Measure the performance of the system and compare it to the expected performance. This should include both the performance of the C++ library and the performance of the F# code when calling the library.

**Usability testing:**<br>
Test the system with end-users to ensure that it is user-friendly and easy to use.

**Documentation testing:**<br>
Verify that all documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
