# Research notes

The client is Harfang 3D, a software developpement company dedicated to the creation of HMIs (human-machine interfaces) for various sectors. 

The society is specialized in Real-Time 3D Visualization, they create useful tools to transform the development of real-time 3D imagery in an industrial context. Indeed, their goal is to popularize their use beyond entertainment purposes, and improve the efficiency of their products. 

One of their popular project, FABGen, a binding generator used to bring the C++ engine to other programming languages, needs an improvement for being more polyvalent and available solutions for their customers. 

Indeed, they are aware that customers didn't want to learn a new programming language while testing their products. So, the society want to help them save time.

## Competition
The society's competitors are potentially other companies offering products and services related to their own engine software. A few notable examples would be Unity and Unreal Engine.

The goal of Harfang3D is to develop their engine for the industrial sector, while its competitors are more focused on the gaming industry. Indeed, while game engine products life esperancy is around only 5 years, while Hardang3D plan to create products which could last up to 30 years.

# Communication

## Who?
It's representants are Fran√ßois Gutherz, CTO ( Chief Technical Officer) and project leader and Emmanuel Julien, lead developer.

## How?

We often get in touch with them in several occasions: through social medias such as Discord, Slack, by mail, but also physically. 

Indeed, they went at Algosup to present their company and their products. They even created a Harfang X Algosup github page to explain the main points of our mission.
