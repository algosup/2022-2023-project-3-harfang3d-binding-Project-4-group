## Client
Who are they and what do they do?
> Our client is Harfang 3D, a company that makes a 3D game engine. They are located in France and they have been working on their engine since 2009. They have a lot of products, but the one we are working on is FABGen, a binding generator.
## Product
​What is it and why the client need our help to improve it ?
> As I said earlier, the product we are working on is FABGen, a binding generator. It is used to generate bindings for different languages. It is used by Harfang 3D to generate bindings for their engine. The client needs our help to improve it because they want to add F# bindings to their engine.

## Ecosystem
​Who will use it and how will they use it?
> The product will be used by Harfang 3D to generate bindings for their engine. It will be used by people who want to use Harfang 3D's engine in F#. Mainly, it will be used by industrial companies.
## Skills
​What skills do you need to have to work with the product?
> Currently, FABGen's users can use FABGen to generate bindings for Python, Lua, and Go for Harfang 3D's engine. 
> We will have to add F# bindings to this list. To do so, we will have to use three languages which are: C++, Python, and F#.

# Roadmap
What are the steps to achieve your goals?
> - Understand what FABGen is and how it works.
> - Study the F# and C++ languages.
> - Learn to bind manually F# and C++ together.
> - Create a F# module for FABGen.
## Organization
